This is a WIP attempt to update the Metroid Mod from tModLoader 1.3 to tModLoader 1.4. It is very broken.

[Link to TODO](./TODO.txt)

As of the current 1.4 preview, the addon system is broken. If someone can fix tML trying to autoload classes that specifically have the Autoload attribute set to false, please do.
