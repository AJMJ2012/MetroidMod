TODOs:
(not in any particular order)

 -	Get new textures for:
	 -	Stardust Hazard Shield Suit
	 -	MPH arm cannons
 -	Figure out and implement screen shaders for:
	 -	X-Ray Visor (implement in Metroid Prime update, make upgrade in Metroid Prime 3: Corruption update)
	 -	Thermal Visor (implement in Metroid Prime update)
	 -	Dark Visor (implement in Metroid Prime 2: Echoes update)
	 -	Echo Visor (implement in Metroid Prime 2: Echoes update)
	 -	Command Visor (implement in Metroid Prime 3: Corruption update)
 -	Fix Kraid multiplayer loot bag
 -	Make Scan Visor lock onto enemies
 -	Find a better way to alert players to the new location of the suit ui, because apparently telling them through the suit's set bonus tooltip isn't good enough.
 -	Sprites for things relating to the Chozo Ruins 'biome' (for use in the Bestiary)
 -	Make a new Mod Menu that isn't explicitly based on NEStroid to fit the new music
	 -	For reference purposes, the new music is stated to be vaguely based on Super Metroid
 -	Balance the new addon system (somehow)
 -	Figure out how to make Hazard Shield shoulderpads draw on primary suits
 -	Make Space Jump Boots conform to the new jump loader
- Netsync the following:
	imperialist invisibiltiy
	powerbeam shotsound
	powerbeam and missile launcher appearance
add right click parry for arm cannon
